# Xamarin Bindings For UberTesters SDK


There are 3 flavours of API:
1.	direct bidnigns which are bound directly to native API (iOS and Android)		
	this is mostly for API investigation and analysis
2.	normalized/homogenized API (abstraction layer over iOS and Android API)		
	used mostly for unified/homogene API layer for cross platform development (Xamarin.Forms)


... and 3 flavours of samples

1.	native classical with 
	1. 	direct bindings			
		Samples.Native.Classical.UberTestersSDK
	2.	normalized/unified bindings			
		these samples will be used for testing and analysis of normalized API
		Samples.Native.Classical.UberTestersSDK.Normalized
2.	native Xamarin.Forms with normalized/unified API
		Samples.Native.XamarinForms.UberTestersSDK.Normalized
